    <h1>APPLE</h1>
<p>An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestic). In France, it is the most consumed
    edible fruit and the third in the planet. The main types of apples come from the domestic apple or common apple. The
    species of Malus Domestica has about 20,000 varieties and cultivars around the world. The fruit has a characteristic
    stocky shape and often spherical, it is eaten when ripe, raw, cooked, or dried. Its juice is drunk fresh or
    pasteurized. When fermented, it becomes cider. Associated with the fruit forbidden in the Book of Genesis, it often
    symbolizes original sin. The fruit we consume today is descended from the Malus Sieversii species; it has been
    consumed by humans since the Neolithic age in the Central. </p>
<p>
    The actual fruit is in the core, the bit we throw away. The same is true of pears. Its colors at maturity change
    from green to red, passing through a wide variety of intermediate shades: pale green, yellow, or orange.
